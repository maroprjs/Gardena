Draft:

Turning valves on/off by SMS (all commands without quotation marks""):
-simple on/off:
"valve X on"	-turns valve X on, where X is 1,2 or 3 (respectively "off" turns valve X off)
"valves on"		-turns all valves on at the same time
"valve X"		-gives status (on/off)
"valves"		-gives status (on/off

-switch to automatic: (by default based on rain sensor)
"valve X  auto"	-turns valve x off when rain detected (by default those commands turn off the valves in question when rain starts)
"valves  auto"	-turns valves off when rain detected (by default those commands turn off the valves in question when rain starts)
"valve X  man"	-disables previous auto funciotnality for valve x
"valves  man"	-disables previous auto funciotnality for all valves
also:
"valve X  moist"	-turns valve x off when moist detected 
"valves  moist"	-turns valves off when moist detected


Getting measurements via SMS:
-simply retrieving value: 
"temp"	-replies SMS temperature
"moist"	-replies measured moisture (A/D converted value only, close to 0 very dry, between 450-600 when sensor put into water) 
"rain"	-raining or no rain
"clock"	-system(rtc) time (time hh:mm	sets time)

-automatic reporting:
"gsm timer|temp|moist|rain rising|falling|start|stop|periodic|reset" -based in conditions; e.g. "rain rain start" reports rain whenever rain detected, or "moist moist rising 200" reports moisture value whenever value raises above 200




changing thresholds for conditional valve switching or auto reporting:
temp|moist|rain Y 	-temperature, moisture or rain set threshold Y; e.g. "moist 100" sets threshold to 100->when "valve on moist falling" is activated, the valves are turned on when moist gets below 100
//timer mmm		-time in minutes; e.g. "time 60" and then "valves on timer" will turn all valves on for one hour and then turn them off
//timer hh:mm 	-start- stop- time (timer mmm should be set to 0, otherwise valves will turn on/off first, for give mmm duration); 

e.g:
temp
temp thr xxx rising|falling|both					-if only one of the thresholds given, both thresholds set equal
temp reset 											-to default conditions
temp temp|etc

moist
moist thrh xxx thrl yyy rising|falling|both			-if only one of the thresholds given, both thresholds set equal
moist reset 										-to default conditions
moist moist|etc.


clock
clock time hh:min
clock date dd:mm:yyyy

timer X
timer X mmm
timer X start hh:mm stop hh:m interval once|daily
timer X reset 										-to default conditions

marker:
(in general: "valve X  moist|rain(=auto/man)|temp|timer	)
(or: "valves moist|rain|temp|timer")	-conditional (rising, falling thresholds are set for moisture, rain, temperature separatly, see bewlo; reset stops condition)

in general: "valve X  moist|rain(=auto/man)|temp|timer rising|falling|reset]"	-conditional (rising, falling thresholds are set for moisture, rain, temperature separatly, see bewlo; reset stops condition)
(or valves moist|rain|temp|timer rising|falling|start|stop|duration|reset]"	-conditional (rising, falling thresholds are set for moisture, rain, temperature separatly, see bewlo; reset stops condition)
